# Here’s what the program does:

#     The command line argument for the keyword is checked.
#     If the argument is save, then the clipboard contents are saved to the keyword.
#     If the argument is list, then all the keywords are copied to the clipboard.
#     Otherwise, the text for the keyword is copied to the clipboard.

# This means the code will need to do the following:

#     Read the command line arguments from sys.argv.
#     Read and write to the clipboard.
#     Save and load to a shelf file.
